Each DNA base from dnaD2 is given to the Mealy machine as
input. When all the DNA bases are given to the Mealy machine, a new DNA sequence i.e., dnaD1 is generated by applying the transition rules of the Mealy machine in the reverse
order. Then, each DNA base of dnaD1 is replaced by its equivalent 2-bit binary value obtained from row (R1) of Table 4. If len
is greater than 256-bit, the binary string is divided into 256-
bit blocks. EXOR operation is performed between each 256-bit
block and 256-bit RASK. If the last block is less than 256-bit,
truncates the RASK and performs the EXOR operation with the
last block. At last, the binary string is replaced by its equivalent ASCII values, which is further converted to the original
plaintext. The algorithm for decrypting the ciphertext using
RASK is presented as Algorithmkn
